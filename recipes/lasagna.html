    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
            Cook lasagna in the boiling water, stirring occasionally 
            until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>  
        <li>Melt margarine in a skillet over low heat; cook and stir flour, salt, and pepper
            into the melted margarine until smooth and bubbling, 2 to 3 minutes. Add milk 
            and broth into flour mixture, stirring constantly; bring sauce to a boil. 
            Stir wine into sauce and remove from heat. Stir Parmesan cheese into sauce 
            until smooth.</li>  
        <li>Whisk ricotta cheese, egg, and egg white together in a bowl.</li>  
        <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; saute carrots, zucchini, 
            and spinach until just becoming tender, 5 to 10 minutes. 
            Stir vegetable mixture into ricotta mixture.</li>  
        <li>Layer 1/3 the lasagna noodles, 1/3 the ricotta-vegetable mixture, 
            and 1/3 the Parmesan sauce in a 9x13-inch baking dish; repeat 
            layering 2 more times with remaining ingredients, ending with a 
            layer of mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is lightly 
            browned and bubbling, about 30 minutes.</li>        
    </ol>
